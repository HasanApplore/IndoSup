Update this website to make it fully responsive across all screen sizes including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

Follow these exact responsive design guidelines:

1. **Responsive Layout**:
   - Use CSS Flexbox or Grid appropriately for layout structure
   - For mobile: Stack elements vertically, ensure spacing and padding remain consistent
   - For tablets and medium screens: Adjust columns to 2-column layout where needed
   - For desktops: Restore full layout with multi-columns (3-4 cards per row in services, 2-column in contact)

2. **Typography & Readability**:
   - Use responsive font sizes with `clamp()`, `vw`, or media queries
   - Ensure headings donâ€™t overflow on small screens
   - Maintain adequate line spacing and padding around text

3. **Navigation Bar**:
   - Convert navbar to a hamburger menu on screens below 768px
   - Ensure clickable area is large enough and nav links are legible

4. **Hero Section**:
   - Make sure heading, subheading, and buttons adjust for smaller screens
   - Hero image or illustration should scale without breaking layout
   - Center-align text and buttons on small screens

5. **Cards and Grid Sections (like Services or Clients)**:
   - Use a responsive grid with `grid-template-columns` or Flexbox
   - Change layout to:
     - 1 column on small screens (mobile)
     - 2 columns on medium screens (tablet)
     - 3-4 columns on large screens

6. **Forms (Contact Section)**:
   - Inputs and buttons must span full width on small screens
   - Add adequate spacing between input fields
   - Submit button should remain prominent and centered if possible

7. **Footer**:
   - Stack content vertically on small screens
   - Reduce font size slightly but maintain readability
   - Social icons should wrap neatly or stack

8. **Images and Media**:
   - All images must use `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`
   - Prevent overflow using `overflow-x: hidden` on `body`

9. **Breakpoints**:
   - Use the following media query breakpoints as base:
     - `max-width: 480px` (phones)
     - `max-width: 768px` (tablets)
     - `max-width: 1024px` (small laptops)
     - Above 1024px for desktops

10. **Final Touches**:
   - Ensure no horizontal scroll on any device
   - Use `box-sizing: border-box` globally
   - Test responsiveness with DevTools or simulator for all major devices

Update the HTML and CSS code accordingly, using clean and organized CSS or inline styles.

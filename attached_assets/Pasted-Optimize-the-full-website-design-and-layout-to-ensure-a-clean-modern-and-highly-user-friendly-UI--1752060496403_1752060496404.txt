Optimize the full website design and layout to ensure a clean, modern, and highly user-friendly UI.

ðŸ”§ Key Instructions:

1. Follow a consistent design schema across all sections:
   - Use a 12-column responsive grid system.
   - Apply balanced spacing (margin, padding) for visual breathing room.
   - Follow a visual hierarchy for headings (H1 â†’ H4), subtitles, and body text.
   - Ensure components have consistent border radius, shadow, and spacing.

2. Typography:
   - Use 'Inter' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' from Google Fonts.
   - Preload fonts for performance.
   - Maintain font sizes using a modular scale (e.g. 16px base, 1.25x scale).
   - Use Tailwind `text-` classes to auto-manage readability on all screens.

3. Responsiveness:
   - Ensure full mobile responsiveness with Tailwind breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
   - Automatically adjust layout, spacing, and font sizes for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
   - Test every section for usability and clean stacking on smaller screens.

4. Image & Media Optimization:
   - Use Next.js `<Image>` component for all images with `layout="responsive"` or `fill`.
   - Apply `lazy` loading to images, and blur-up placeholders where needed.
   - Optimize video embeds with lazy loading and fallbacks.
   - Add proper `alt` tags to all images for accessibility and SEO.

5. Animation & Interaction:
   - Use Framer Motion + GSAP for scroll-based, hover, and reveal animations.
   - Keep animations lightweight and smooth (ease-in-out, spring, fade, zoom).
   - Avoid animation jank â€” respect user preference for reduced motion.

6. Performance Enhancements:
   - Enable code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components.
   - Use `next/font` for font optimization and FCP boost.
   - Ensure all LCP images are optimized and served from the CDN.
   - Follow best practices to pass Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS).

7. UI Polish:
   - Use color palette:
     - Primary: #FFC600
     - Secondary: #FFFFFF
     - Accent: #031D33
     - Neutral Dark: #222629
     - Neutral Base: #919191
   - Apply consistent hover effects (scale, underline, glow) using Tailwind.
   - Use a sticky header, animated buttons, and clean footer layout.
   - Maintain visual consistency for cards, forms, banners, and lists.

ðŸ§  Result:
The website should now look visually stunning, responsive, fast-loading, with each section automatically styled, dimensioned, and spaced to follow a consistent, world-class UI/UX system â€” without any need to manually fix font sizes, spacing, or layout later.
